## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB (locally or through a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git
   cd todo-list-app
2. Install the backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
4. Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your MongoDB connection string and other configurations:

    ```bash
    
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your_mongo_uri
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    PORT=5000

5. Run the development servers:

Open two terminal windows and run the following commands:

In the first terminal (for the backend):
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev

In the second terminal (for the frontend):

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run start
Your application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 for the frontend and http://localhost:5000 for the backend.
